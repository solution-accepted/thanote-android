//    text: A string of the fact text itself.
//    found: Boolean of whether there was a fact for the requested number.
//    number: The floating-point number that the fact pertains to. This may be useful for, eg. a /random request or notfound=floor. For a date fact, this is the 1-indexed day of a leap year (eg. 61 would be March 1st).
//    type: String of the category of the returned fact.
//    date (sometimes): A day of year associated with some year facts, as a string.
//    year (sometimes): A year associated with some date facts, as a string.
